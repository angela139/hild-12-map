                <h4><b>1910 - Beginning of Japanese occupation of Korea</b></h4>
                <p>Japanese began migrating to Korea and begin their take over.
                    A Japanese agricultural company Taki Seihi Company, started by Taki Kumejiro, acquires land in
                    the fertile lands of Honam Plains in Korea to grow his fertilizer business.

                <p>The Taki Seihi Company build their headquarters along with a large plantation at Kimje/Gimje. Some members of the Kim
                    family begin working on their plantation. They are given low wages and face terrible working
                    conditions due to the Japanese unchecked economic power in Korea.

                <p>Taki Kumejiro uses his profits from the Kimje plantation to grow a fertilizer business in Befu-cho,
                    Japan. The Kim family workers are forced to move to Befu-cho by the Taki Seihi Company where they
                    continue to face difficult conditions. The Koreans are seen as inferior to the Japanese.

                <p>Manchukuo is a puppet state set up by Japan in Northeast China. The members of the Kim family that
                    stayed in Korea move to Manchukuo to escape the poverty and horrible conditions in Korea from the
                    Japanese takeover. They begin working in coal mines alongside Chinese workers, as the coal industry
                    is a huge part of the Japanese energy industry. However, they continue to feel marginalized and
                    excluded by the Koreans and Chinese.

                <h4><b>1945 - end of Japanese control in Korea</b></h4>
                <p>Korea gains independence from Japan, but the Korean War ensues between North (communist) and South
                    Korea (democratic). This severely damages both economies. Koreans in Manchukuo are given the region
                    of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. The Kim family get settled in the region, living near the
                    Tumen River which borders North Korea. They regularly see North Korean refugees who cross the river
                    to escape the bad conditions in North Korea.

                <p>Some members of the Kim family migrate to South Korea to make more money amid the economic struggle
                    in Yanbian. They send money back to their family members and hope to be reunited soon.
